Other useful stuff. Primarily for working with LXplus

#bashrc

Your .bashrc file lives in your home directory. You wont be able to see it with the 
```bash
ls
```

command unless you add an "-a"

```bash

ls -a
```

##Local bashrc 
Contains things you might find useful to have in your local .bashrc (on the machine in front of you). You'll need to change any reference to my CERN username (oreardon) to yours.

##Remote bashrc
Contains tings you might want in your .bashrc on the remote server (probably LXPlus)
